# Installing Neovim in Gitpod     

### Goal:   
Use [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) as primary IDE inside [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) workspaces.    
Just by connecting to the workspace from a terminal.    

### How:    
 
By setting `https://github.com/daliendev/gitpod-install-neovim` as Gitpod Dotfiles repository in [gitpod.io/preferences](https://gitpod.io/preferences),     
Neovim will be installed with the appropriate [configuration](https://github.com/daliendev/astro-nvim) in every Gitpod workspace.      

### (Optional) Requirements: Get a Nerd Font      
*(install it on the system, e.g. on Windows for WSL2)*     

If you haven't installed it yet, you might need a Nerd Font on the terminal you'll use to connect to the Gitpod Workspace via SSH.
